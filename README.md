# Powerball
## Overview
A Roblox game where two competing players must score coloured balls in the the centre bins while avoiding opposing defenders.
## Project Layout
 - *default.project.json*: the Rojo project config file
 - *World.rbxmx*: The Roblox world file
 - *src*: Lua scripts
    - *ServerScriptService*: Game scripts which will be run on the server and __not__ replicated to game clients
## Building
The game is a [Roblox Studio](https://www.roblox.com/create) project scripted with the [Rojo](https://rojo.space/) extension for better project management.

In Visual Studio Code with the Rojo extension, the project can be built by running `CTRL` + `SHIFT` + `P` and entering the command `Rojo: Build place/model file`
